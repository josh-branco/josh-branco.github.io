- BPS - Requested & Recommended
- Capital Budget Detail
- Fund Balance
- Narrative Report
- Line Item Budget

## Department Head Meetings

- Include SMART goals on the agenda

## Best Practices

- Publish a PDF from the Narrative system when submitting to Jay

### Adopted Budget

- Check spreadsheet in my peer review folder to determine if the department's adopted budget was affected by the ACO's error. If so, I will need to rerun the line item report.

### Extra Help

- Major Budget Changes
	- 	Call out as an individual major budget change when the FTE changes.
	- Include as a salary and benefits adjustment when only the amount is changing.
- Combo Budgets
	- Cents in extra-help tax calculations can cause totals in combo budgets to add incorrectly. 
	- Ensure they add correctly down the column.
		- If there's an error forward to Imran to correct and copy Brenda.

### Rounding Error

- A rounding error is occurring because the system is rounding the monthly actuals **every month**, and then totaling the rounded monthly amounts, as opposed to rounding after the monthly totals have already been summed.
- If the 21-22 actual amounts are off, please review the ACO monthly reports to determine the object where the discrepancy is located, and send a message requesting a fix to Imran, Joe, and Brenda.
- [ ] Check NCC and the objects for 21-22 and adjusted budget against the ACO worksheets

### Workforce

#### Benefits

- New positions in Bargaining Unit C are receiving Cafeteria benefits as well as Medical, Dental, and Vision.
	- To fix, ISD must manually remove the Cafeteria amount.

#### New Positions + ANP Review Process

- Check the new position report in the system and make sure we have NP forms for everything that has been added.
	- Email NP forms to the HR classifications inbox.
- Review the department's vacancy rate when considering new positions and/or ANPs

### Central Telephone

**Workload Data**
The 2021-2022 Actuals match the 2021-2022 Estimated Actuals because the manager of the team retired, and some of the workload data he collected was lost. The 2021-2022 Estimated Actuals were used in the narrative for 2023-2024, because they are the most accurate data available.
 
**Service Table**
4 circuits were added to the budget after the initial figures were developed, which created a discrepancy between the Services Table and the Schedule 9. The corrected total is $6,138,202. The remaining variance is due to costs recovered through means other than department billings:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Total Appropriations** | **7,204,202** |
| Network Switch Refresh | (675,000) |
| Firewall Refresh | (285,000) |
| SaaS Telecom Pilot | (98,000) |
| Interest Income | (8,000) |
| **Net Billed Services** | **6,138,202** |
